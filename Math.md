# Math library #

There are several mathematical types and utilities defined
  * Vector
  * Quaternion
  * Matrix
  * Transform   - for expressing affine transforms in a cheaper way than what Matrix has to offer
  * EulerAngles - created mostly for angle edition purposes, as it expresses rotations in a human readable form, as opposed to quaternions and matrices

For details - just referer to the code ( core/Math.h )
