Graphs are a building block of many engine systems, thus we provide a wide range of tools to operate on them.

==Graph builder==

===Rationale===
A `GraphBuilder` is a resource that allows to define a graph in an easy way, and serializing such a construct. Whenever needed, we can instantiate a `Graph` structure from such a builder.

Why can't we serialize the `Graph` itself? - simple. In order to be able to serialize pointers to objects, we need to make them `Objects` - and that costs memory and performance.

And since graphs tend to be used in tender code areas, we need the leanest structure possible. Thus we decided to split a graph instance from its definition.

===How to use it===
