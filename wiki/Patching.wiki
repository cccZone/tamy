=Patching=

Very often you will require to change definitions of certain types - the code evolves, it's being refactored - that's just how it is.

The problem is that you may be loading data from your resource files that reference those types. 
How should the reflection system know how to load them then, since the definition has changed?

Patching to the rescue!
