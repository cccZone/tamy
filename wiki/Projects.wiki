Tamy allows you to divide your repository among many projects you can share resources between.


==Activating a project==

Before you can start working with anything, you need to select an existing project or create a new one.

You do that from the *Projects* tab of the *resources browser*.
This tab shows the directory structure with files or resources (depending on your view settings ), but doesn't allow you to modify any of them or create new one - notice that their names are greyed out. 

You can create your project file anywhere you like. Once you create it, double click it to make it an active project.

Notice how the color of the window changes to reflect that you're now working with a project.

==Selecting project directories==

If you don't activate a project, Tamy won't display anything in the *Files* tab of the resources browser, thus not letting you edit or create any new resources.

Once you'll activate a project, you'll notice the *Files* tab gets populated with directories.

In the beginning, you'll notice just one directory there - *Renderer*.
It's a directory that contains all basic resources used by the engine.

In order to be able to use data from your repository, you need to add other directories to the project - so simply go to the *Projects* tab, select a directory you want to add to your project, right-click on it and select *Add to project* from the drop-down menu.
