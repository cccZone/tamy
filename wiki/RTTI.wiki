=RTTI=

Engine's runtime type identification system. 

It's acutally a little bit more than that - it supports serialization, objects with properties etc.

But let's start slow :)

==Class==

==Classes registry==

==Object==

==Properties==

You can make anything a property - all it needs to have is a defined `serialize` method.
Here's an example:

{{{
struct MyStruct
{
   int m_data;

   friend Serializer& operator<<( Serializer& serializer, MyStruct& rhs )
   {
      serializer << rhs .m_data;
      return serializer;
   }
};
}}}
