=Serialization util=

`ReflectionSerializationUtil` is a swiss army knife when it comes to serialization.

It allows you to serialize:

  * individual objects - in this mode it will discard all referenced resources and save only the specified object and its internal hierarchy. It's not a good mode to serialize something that references resources.
{{{
}}}

  * groups of resources - these methods are perfect for saving resources and their entire network of dependencies.

==Dependencies mapper==

If you want to find out what resources a particular object depends on, you can simply call `collectExternalDependencies`, and the method will return a list of `FilePaths` to the referenced resources.
